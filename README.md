Welcome to the Zocdoc Information Security Team (ZocSec) SecurityAsCode repository for AWS.  Part of the ZocSec mandate is to use AWS's in-built technologies to automate the remediation of common security problems.   In this repository, ZocSec presents code & configuration used to lock down our AWS environment.
